Type: diagram", "video_desc": "", "narration": "An avalanche photodiode is a specialized semiconductor photodetector designed to detect weak optical signals.

Type: illustration", "video_desc": "", "narration": "The operation of an APD begins with the absorption of a photon within the device's active region generating an electronhole pair. A high reverse bias voltage is applied across the photodiode accelerating these carriers. As these carriers move through the depletion region they gain sufficient kinetic energy to ionize other atoms in the lattice creating additional electronhole pairs. This cascading process known as impact ionization or the avalanche effect results in a significant amplification of the initial photocurrent.", "image_url": "https://unacademy.com/content/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Zener-breakdown-and-avalanche-breakdown-docx-Google-Docs-300x213.png", "image_path": "data/videos/25621a8b-cfb3-4c05-8dbc-295eae963482/images/image_3.webp", "video_url": "", "video_path": ""}, {"slide_number": "4", "title": "APD Structure", "slide_type": "Image Right", "content": "p-i-n or separate absorption and multiplication (SAM) structure.\nAbsorption region for efficient photon capture.\nMultiplication region for avalanche gain.\nGuard ring to prevent premature breakdown.", "image_desc": "APD cross-section.
